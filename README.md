<h3 align="center">Re.tifica โข 4ยบ Ioasys Bootcamp Final Challenge </h3>

 <p align="center">
    "Re.tifica" was the result of the final project of the 4th Ioasys Bootcamp, where it is a facilitator in the documentation rectification process for trans and transvestites. Through the application, you have access to all the information and guidance you need to start your journey in the process of changing your name and/or gender on your Birth Certificate.

<i>Note: The main product was designed as a mobile application and this is the product's LandingPage, which you can get more information about and which I was responsible for creating.</i>

The 4th Bootcamp Ioasys was a moment of immersion and improvement of Front-end knowledge. Where in the beginning we received training about Web Vanilla (JS, HTML, CSS) and then approaching ReactJS + Axios. At the end of the camp, after presenting the project, we managed to be among the top 3 projects among 8 teams, each team with 11 participants from all technology fronts, such as Front-end, Back-end, Product, Scrum master, etc.

To run the project on your computer, just follow the step-by-step instructions below!
